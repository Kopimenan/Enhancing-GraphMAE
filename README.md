# Enhancing-GraphMAE
Enhancing Graph Masked Autoencoders (GraphMAE) with Few-Shot Graph Learning

## 🚀 Run on Google Colab

You can run this notebook directly on **Google Colab**.

> 💡 Recommended Runtime: **T4 GPU**  
> (Go to: *Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → GPU → T4*)

If any installation or import fails, please install dependencies from `requirements.txt` — these match the original environment used for experiments.

## ⚠️ Note on Opening the Notebook

Even you encounter a message saying **"Invalid Notebook"** when trying to preview this notebook directly on GitHub, don’t worry — this happens because of missing widget metadata in the notebook file (`metadata.widgets`).

> 💡 **Workaround:**  
> You can still run the notebook perfectly fine in **Google Colab** by following these steps:
>
> 1. Click the **“Download raw file”** option (top right of the notebook preview on GitHub).  
> 2. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
> 3. Upload the downloaded `.ipynb` file to Colab.  
> 4. Set **Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU → T4 (Preferred)**.  
> 5. Run all cells — the notebook will execute normally.  
>
> If any dependency fails to install, simply run the first setup cell, which installs everything from the included `requirements.txt` file.
